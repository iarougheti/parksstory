<h2>
  No matter which of San Francisco’s 36 neighborhoods one lives in, they’re never more than ten minutes’ walk from at least one public park, from the massive Golden Gate Park to the single tree in the Tenderloin National Forest. 
</h2>

Towards the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, parks nonprofit groups around the city, including the San Francisco Parks Alliance, found this easy access made parks an invaluable resource to isolated residents - making even the smallest parks more popular than ever. 

</p>
<p class="body-text">
  “Most people didn't feel comfortable going into each other's homes for the vast majority of the last two years,” said Rachel Kovinsky, Senior Associate for Marketing + Special Events at the San Francisco Parks Alliance. “People really do gather in these spaces and kind of use them as an alternative to like a backyard or a living room.”
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  Greenspace use in San Francisco governs conversations about parks owned at the city, state and federal levels, said Kearstin Krehbiel, Director of Research and Development at the San Francisco Parks Alliance. But it increasingly also means getting creative about promoting miniature spaces - creating local patches of greenery as unique as the neighborhoods comprising San Francisco - which will remain popular even as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on city life continue to unfold. 
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  “The thing that is so important about parks is that they are one of the most democratic institutions in our country,” Krehbiel said. “They are, it's public land, and it's made available for everybody to use and making sure that they are accessible and vibrant and reflective of the communities that they serve.”
</p>

<p class="subhead">
  New world, new habits
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  There are currently 220 neighborhood parks across the city, spanning more than 3,400 acres.
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  As stay-at-home orders lift around the city in recent months, the Parks Alliance has been working to catch those whose relationships to parks in San Francisco have changed, and provide examples and opportunities for people to come together around new schedules or hobbies they may have started to associate with parks during the pandemic.
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  Krehbiel pointed out that people tend to associate parks with recreation spaces that have enough room for people to engage in physical activities or hang out in groups. The city has tried to capture this energy with a slate of recurring programming in mini-parks, scaling down the appeal of constant activity with installations from fairy gardens to sidewalk chalk campaigns. 
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  “[During COVID,] a lot of our normal life was disrupted. And so that forced people in a very, like, real, tangible, physical way to stay home and explore what they can walk to,” said Krehbiel.  “And so we saw an uptick in people recreating in their hyperlocal - meaning walkable from their house - facilities and playgrounds.”
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  Fitness classes hosted outside have skyrocketed in popularity, Krehbiel said, and people have become more enamored with those parks walking distance from their house, even if they’re less extensive than old favorites accessible by car or train. People have begun flocking to shared spaces - public recreation spaces which multiple businesses or groups can use for hosting programming and art - as well as slow streets where walkers and joggers can share space with minor vehicles.
</p>

<p class="body-text" margin-bottom="10px;">
  Recently, the group partnered with the San Francisco Bike Coalition to sponsor a night bike ride through Golden Gate Park, during which riders dressed in glow-in-the-dark clothing celebrated the expansion of bike use in the park within the last several years - due in part to the closure of some portions of the main street running through the park. 
</p>

<p class="body-text" margin-top="10px;">
  Road and highway closures implemented during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic have been a major expansion point for multiple parks across San Francisco. Along the western edge of the city, the Great Highway trail and bike path, which runs along the coast between the Pacific Ocean and its namesake highway, saw a major expansion when the highway closed during the pandemic, turning the road itself into a secondary walking and cycling path. 
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  The highway remains closed on weekends, and the Great Highway has now become the city’s second most popular park, according to Krehbiel. 
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  While she echoes many park users in being excited about the path’s reuse, especially for younger riders, some longtime bikers worry that turning infrastructure like highways into park spaces presents accessibility problems. One biker, Andrew S.  [Szeto: let’s talk about anonymity in drafts], expressed worry that closing the Great Highway would make the park inaccessible to visitors from the East side of the city who would no longer be able to drive up to the area, especially those from neighborhoods already underserved by SF’s municipal transit system.  
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  He also urged the SF Parks Alliance and other planning agencies to continue focusing on projects that brought parks to underserved areas with low green space, rather than high-income, low-renter areas like the Great Highway’s Lower Richmond.
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  “It was nice that [the Great Highway] was closed for biking reasons,” said Andrew, who’s visited the Great Highway bike trail multiple times a week since childhood. “But I have a lot of political views about this as far as how space is used or how I use space.” 
</p>

<p class="subhead">
Beyond Greenspace  
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  As the way people interact with green spaces has changed, the Parks Alliance and other groups have had to think about what makes this activity-based relationship unique from engagement with plazas, community gardens and other public land plots. These bring fresh greenery, but don’t have that same focus on play.
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  Enabling play was at the forefront of Krehbiel’s mind when her team tackled one of their most recent projects, revitalizing a SOMA alleyway under what used to be a sky bridge connecting two department stores. The 500-block of Stevenson Street where the project sits is pure concrete and known more as a cultural site than a play space. However, the SF Parks Alliance noted that it was situated in an area with an unusually high density of children but an unusually low density of recognized parks or recreational areas, Krehbiel said. 
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  The team focused on pulling from some of the qualities of parks that appeal to young users and inspire physical activity, installing a basketball hoop, string lights and murals and bringing in a multi-month series of vendors and entertainers for community members to enjoy. 
</p>

<p class="body-text">
 “ We paired [the project] along with, you know, a neighborhood's longer standing goals of just overall improvements to the space by adding some capital projects and some art,” Krehbiel said.
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  Kovinsky said that the city’s most successful park revitalization projects have been those that integrate new fitness and play facilities into beloved neighborhood spaces, rather than importing completely new infrastructure which would ignore a land plot’s past life.
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  “There is a crazy amount of history that I can go on for a while about in parks here, but it would have to be specific to how every park has such a story,” Kovinsky said. “People just really use their parks here.”
</p>


<p class="subhead">
  Parks for All
</p>


<p class="body-text">
  Looking ahead, Krehbiel said that the parks department and the SF Parks Alliance are trying to focus on finding creative park space in areas that have previously been inaccessible or uninhabitable - like former industrial spaces or even onetime toxic waste sites - and then creating programming to help residents bond with their new mini-parks.
</p>


<p class="body-text">
Some SF parks are decades or centuries old, but Krehbiel said that in the last 20 years or so, she’s seen developers approaching construction and revitalization projects with more of an equity mindset.
</p>


<p class="body-text">
  The greatest successes the group’s had in creating community-driven spaces, she said, have come from identifying poorly maintained parks around the city and working backwards to understand the new needs of residents nearby. 
</p>


<p class="body-text">
  Such an understanding usually comes two-fold. Structurally, developers are considering both the ways in which socioeconomic disadvantage factors like redlining and gentrification have shaped green space access in each neighborhood over time.  
</p>


<p class="body-text"> 
Emotionally, meanwhile, they’re curious about what new features would help kids see repurposed spaces, from grass to asphalt, like a canvas for imaginative play.
</p>


<p class="body-text">
  In Krehbiel’s experience, this collaboration is unique to San Francisco parks. 
</p>


<p class="body-text">
  “There's a community design process, that's part of every playground in San Francisco, so that like, the locals who live in that neighborhood, get to say, you know, ‘I want something that's more like a woodland theme,’” she said. “I mean, we've got an airplane in a playground, we've a purple dragon that was designed by the community that's in a playground in San Francisco. You don't see that in other cities like New York. It makes us go slower.”
